        The melanistic leopard, also known as the black panther, is a large wild cat found in various parts of the world, including Africa and Asia. 
        Unlike typical leopards, which have a golden or yellow coat with distinctive spots called rosettes, melanistic leopards have a dark black coat. 
        These dark coats are a result of a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair coloration. 
        Despite their dark appearance, melanistic leopards still have the same physical characteristics and behaviors as their lighter counterparts. 
        They are solitary and elusive animals, skilled hunters capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves. 
        Melanistic leopards are often revered in local folklore and are considered symbols of strength and stealth.
