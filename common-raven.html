        The common raven, scientifically known as Corvus corax, is a large black bird found across various regions of the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa. 
        Known for its intelligence and adaptability, the common raven has a distinctive deep croaking call and is often seen soaring through the sky or perched atop trees. 
        With a wingspan of up to four feet, these birds are skilled fliers and can be observed performing aerial acrobatics. 
        Ravens are opportunistic feeders, scavenging for a wide range of food including carrion, insects, small mammals, fruits, and grains. 
        They are also known for their complex social behaviors and ability to problem-solve, making them fascinating creatures to study.
